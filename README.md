# Agency CRM (OMN-56)

A fully custom internal sales CRM web app — replaces third-party CRM SaaS
(HubSpot integration cancelled). Single-file static SPA, same stack as the EOS
Tracker, bound to the canonical CRM backend (OMN-59).

**Live preview:** GitHub Pages — `bkocs7189/crm-preview`
(https://bkocs7189.github.io/crm-preview/)
**Sign-in:** Supabase Auth (email/password). A demo board login is provisioned
for preview/QA — see *Access* below.

## Modules (OMN-60 design-spec 6-module IA; conformance closed in OMN-74)
- **Dashboard** — open pipeline, weighted forecast (server-computed), Won-MTD-vs-target bar, pipeline-by-stage, top open deals, activity feed, and **needs-attention** nudges (overdue / stalled / cold)
- **Contacts** — people (polymorphic `contacts.kind`), search, tags, **cold-contact** flag (no activity 30d+)
- **Companies** — first-class accounts module; people roll up; open pipeline summed per account
- **Pipeline** — Kanban (drag-to-move stage); live column totals; **stalled-deal** flag (in-stage >21d, amber edge); Won→confirm-amount / Lost→reason on stage move
- **Deals** — forecast table; weighted (computed) column + filter-aware footer totals; Open/Won/Lost/All segments
- **Activities** — calls / emails / meetings / notes / tasks logged against contacts & deals

## Shared layer (§3)
Global search (people/companies/deals), global `[+ New]`, **owner-scope** filter
(All / Mine / Unassigned via `owner_id`), **Editor/Viewer** read-only variant
(UX only — RLS is the real boundary), and an optimistic **6s undo toast** on
every mutation (real inverse Supabase writes).

## Stack
- Single-file static SPA (`index.html`), no build step — deploys to GitHub Pages
- Shared backend: Supabase Postgres (project **Convergence** `krthbgtykwamxqvapxnx`),
  schema `public`, canonical tables from OMN-59:
  `pipelines`, `pipeline_stages`, `contacts`, `deals`, `activities`, `notes`
- **Computed server-side:** `deals.weighted_value` is a generated column
  (`value × probability`); a trigger inherits the stage default probability and
  syncs `status`/`closed_at` on won/lost stages. The SPA never computes or writes
  these — it reads them back after each write.
- Writes are **per-row** (insert / update / delete) and re-select the affected row
  so generated + trigger-set fields round-trip into the UI immediately.

## Access & security posture
- Entry is gated by **Supabase Auth** (email/password sign-in). This replaces the
  earlier SHA-256 access-code gate.
- RLS grants CRUD only to the `authenticated` role; the `anon` (publishable) key
  alone returns **nothing**. The publishable key in `index.html` only identifies
  the project and is safe to ship.
- Demo board login for preview/QA: `crm-demo@agency.local` / `CrmDemo2026!`
  (a confirmed Supabase Auth user; rotate or remove before any real customer data).
  **Do not recreate or re-seed this account** — it already exists and is
  email-confirmed. Recreating it re-hashes the password and drifts it away from
  this documented value (observed once during OMN-75; QA reset it back). If the
  password ever needs changing, update it here in the same change so docs and the
  Supabase Auth account stay in sync.
- This closes the anon-CRUD exposure of the previous `crm56_*` prototype tables,
  which the backend (OMN-59) and security review (OMN-62) are dropping.

## Schema deltas (tracked on OMN-67)
The canonical schema is leaner than the earlier prototype. Fields with no column
in OMN-59 were dropped from the UI rather than faked: per-row text `owner`
(canonical uses `owner_id` → `auth.users`, auto-set to the signed-in user),
company `industry`, person `custom_fields`, activity `done`/task-checkbox, and
freeform per-entity `notes` text (a dedicated `notes` table exists and can back a
notes panel later). Restoring these is a schema decision for Backend on OMN-67.
